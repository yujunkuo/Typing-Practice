      const e1 = `     Quantum computing and AI aren't just two parallel research fields
that happen to meet somewhere. They're more like a match made in
heaven. The hotly anticipated quantum supremacy, when it unequivocally
arrives, would be a landmark achievement in and of itself. However,
it is not really about "when" we get to this milestone more than "how"
to handle its after-effects. Big Data is the nexus between AI and
quantum computers. The former needs data and lots of it to learn and
improve its intelligence. The latter are well-equipped to deal with
huge swaths of data in a time-efficient manner.
     Sudden hearing loss is mostly treated using steroids, supplemented
by HBOT. The steroids can be administered orally or through injection,
either into the ear or intravenously. If steroids are administered
within two weeks of the onset of the symptoms the prognosis is very
good; if this treatment is supplemented by HBOT, the hearing of around
three-quarters of patients shows a clear improvement.
     Miranda Hollingshead, 27, was visiting the Crater of Diamonds State
Park in Arkansas in a family outing. They'd been at the park for about
an hour, when she decided to take a break at the base of a hill. She
fired up the YouTube video and started watching. The park allows its
visitors to search for diamonds in a designated 37.5-acre area.
     Billions of tons of meltwater flowing into the world's oceans from
the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets could boost extreme weather and
destabilize regional climate in a matter of decades, researchers said.
The melting ice giants, especially the one atop Greenland, are poised to
further weaken the ocean currents that move cold water south along the
Atlantic Ocean's floor, while pushing tropical waters northward closer
to the surface, scientists reported in the journal, Nature.
     Users enter their name and ID number to find out whether they have
been in close contact with someone infected. Those who have been are
advised to stay home and get in touch with local health authorities.
According to the WHO, signs of infection include fever, cough, and
shortness of breath and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases,
it can lead to pneumonia, SARS, kidney failure and even death.
     Despite concerns, almost half believe the internet contributes to
their identity, with a similar number suggesting it helps them feel
better emotionally or less alone, while others admitted they would be
lost without the internet altogether. The survey also shines a light
on experiences of disabled young people, 54% of whom said they find
it easier to be themselves online than offline.
     Yasuke's origins remain a mystery as historical sources are scant.
While some researchers believe he was from Mozambique, others suggest
Sudan. Lockley suspects that Yasuke was abducted from his family as a
child by Arab or Indian slave traders and trafficked through Arab
countries and across the Indian Ocean. He likely worked as a slave
and trained as a child soldier who fought in Gujarat and Goa in India,
before being hired as a valet by Jesuit missionaries from Portugal. `;
      const e2 = `     Michael Jordan, who grew up in Wilmington, North Carolina, close to
where Florence came ashore as a Category 1 hurricane, has donated $2
million to relief and recovery agencies. "It's truly devastating for me
to see the damage that Hurricane Florence is doing to my beloved home
state of North Carolina and to the surrounding areas," Jordan, who is
the owner of the Charlotte Bobcats of the NBA, said last week in a
statement posted on the team's website announcing its charity work.
     Kipchoge's split times left many viewers scratching their heads as
they tried to work out just how fast the race was won. The Kenyan was
led out from the start by three pacemakers and he clocked the first 10
kilometers in world record pace. Shortly after the halfway mark, all
three pacemakers dropped out, leaving Kipchoge to run the final 10 miles
alone. But where most athletes would struggle, Kipchoge continued to
defy the odds and instead of falling off the pace, he actually sped up.
     Prince William went on rhino spotting trip in Namibia to learn more
about conservation and the illegal wildlife trade in Africa. The Duke
of Cambridge went rhino spotting with a team of local rangers on a 5am
trek in the country's mountainous region, Kensington Palace said in
a tweet. He praised the "beauty and sheer remoteness" of Namibia's
landscape as he spotted a rare black rhino after five hours. The
Duke of Cambridge said he was humbled by the rangers dedication towards
protecting Namibia's rhinos population from poachers.
     "Q" words are always tough, especially those without a "u" in them.
Players can monetize with the word qapik, which is a unit of currency
in Azerbaijan. The updated version of the players dictionary continues
to follow some of the game's most important rules. Words must still
come from the standard dictionary. No abbreviations, capitalized words
or words with punctuation are allowed.
     Every week seems to bring new confirmation we've officially entered
the era of too much tourism. There's been sand pilfering in Sardinia
and Venice visitors threatened with fines for sitting down. Over in
Rome, there's been selfie-based violence and illegal bathing. In
Madrid, stringent rules have been put in place to handle Airbnb as
locals fear being priced out of the city.
     FIFA has suspended Sierra Leone from world football over claims of
government interference. The suspension comes after FIFA sent a letter
to the country's Minister of Sports expressing "grave concern" about the
removal of the football association president, Isha Johansen and the
association's General Secretary, Christopher Kamara.
     But a study released this week found that the Brazilian bird is now
extinct in the wild. The Spix's macaw is one of eight bird species,
half of them in Brazil, confirmed extinct or suspected extinct in the
report from BirdLife International. Deforestation is a leading cause
of the Spix's macaw's disappearance from its natural habitat, according
to the report. For the first time, extinctions on the mainland are
outpacing those on islands, the study says. `;
      const e3 = `     People also shopped more on their phones depending on what day it
was. Adobe found that smartphones accounted for slightly more traffic
than desktop computers on Thanksgiving, but not on Black Friday. You
may not whip out your laptop when you have friends and family over,
but you'll definitely pull out your phone for some sneaky browsing.
     Nocturnal primates not only regularly consume alcohol in fermented
nectars, saps and fruits, but they also seem to love it, finds new
research on two night-prowling primate species: the aye-aye and the
slow loris. Aye ayes (Daubentonia madagascariensis) are lemurs native
to Madagascar that have an elongated, bony finger for detecting and
extracting grubs from decaying tree trunks.
     Finally, they found a catamaran company that agreed to ferry them
to Puerto Rico. They chose that island over St. Croix because it had
avoided a direct hit from Irma and therefore had more outbound flights
scheduled. Upon arrival, though, the family couldn't afford the $1,500
per person being charged for a flight out.
     Currently, cognitive behavioral therapy is considered the best form
of treatment for insomnia, according to the American Academy of Sleep
Medicine. During treatment, people learn to identify and change the
harmful thoughts and behaviors that are preventing them from getting
enough sleep, the researchers explained.
     What makes this lunar photobomb so special is that we're seeing a
side to the moon we Earthlings never see from our planet's surface.
The moon is tidally locked with Earth, meaning the moon's spin matches
its orbit, ensuring the same face is always facing Earth. To see the
lunar far side, we need to send a camera beyond the moon's orbit and
look back at Earth, which is exactly what the NASA Earth Polychromatic
Imaging Camera (EPIC) does. And the sequence of images have picked
out some beautiful detail in the moon's terrain.
     Unusually, the rise is not in terms of patient numbers, which have
in fact fallen, but by people living longer with greater numbers of
increasingly complex conditions to manage. Each day, Mowle will have
contact with 40 to 50 patients, he explained, with 60% of those in
person and the rest through phone consultations.
     Velasco Archer noted that this type of cranial deformation is more
likely found in the southern part of Mesoamerica rather than in the
Mexican central region where Teotihuacan is located. Encrusted with
two round pyrite stones, the skull's front teeth confirmed the woman
was a foreigner in Teotihuacan. The dental decoration technique is
typical of Mayan regions in southern Mexico and Central America.
     At some point in time, after the first man and woman were buried,
a second man was buried in a grave inside a wooden structure that was
added to the original tomb. This man was also buried with his ax,
although it was not as large as the ax from the original burial, the
researchers said. Nielsen thinks the second man could have been a
relative or successor of the first man. `;
